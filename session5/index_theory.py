index

Each item in a list is called an element.

An index is an integer that identifies a particular element in a list.
Indexes always start at zero in Python.


#  			0				1             2              3
names = ["Arpya Roy", "Samuel Rowe", "Sreem Chowdhary", "Ayushmann Khurrana"]
print(names[3])

You can access a particular element using the subscript operator.
Syntax:
list_name[index]
